## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🔍 Mental Fatigue Prediction via Typing Patterns
> **Tech:** `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `SHAP`, `pandas`, `FastAPI`  
> Built an ML pipeline to detect early signs of mental fatigue from user typing behavior. Integrated SHAP for explainability and deployed the API for real-time predictions.

### 📦 Takeaway Ordering Backend
> **Tech:** `FastAPI`, `Pydantic`, `PostgreSQL`, `Docker`  
> RESTful API for a takeaway service featuring user management, menu CRUD, and order tracking with CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

### 🧾 Bankruptcy Risk Prediction
> **Tech:** `XGBoost`, `SMOTE`, `Optuna`, `Pandas Profiling`  
> Explored financial KPIs and engineered composite ratios to improve prediction of bankruptcy risk. Achieved 90%+ ROC AUC with tuned ensemble models.

### 🤖 NLP Blog Sentiment Analysis
